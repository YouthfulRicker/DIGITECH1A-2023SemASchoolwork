Create if/else program and a user-prompted loop, and enclose code in a function.

### if-else.py

if-else.py is a basic program to showcase an if/else statement. I took the narrative of a responsible adult introducing someone to clubbing, with age and name variables to simulate a conversation.

### loop.py

In loop.py there's a showcase of a loop where a child keeps asking during a road trip "Are we there yet?", causing a loop of response that is controlled by the player. No being a redo of the program, Yes being a HALT.
