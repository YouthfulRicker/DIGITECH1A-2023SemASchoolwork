// This program is a simple number guessing game.

// Generate a random number between 1 and 100
numero = random_number(1, 100)

// Set the attempt count to 6
attempt_count = 6

// Repeat until the attempt count reaches 0 or the player guesses the correct number
while attempt_count > 0:
    // Prompt the player to enter their guess
    guess = input("Guess the number!\n")

    // If the player's guess is equal to the random number
    if guess == numero:
        print("You got it whooooo!!!")
        break
    // If the player's guess is incorrect
    else:
        print("Not quite right. Try again.")

    // Decrease the attempt count by 1
    attempt_count = attempt_count - 1

// If the player runs out of attempts
if attempt_count == 0:
    print("Sorry, you're out of attempts. The correct number was", numero)
