// This program is a simple number guessing game.

// Generate a random number between 1 and 100
numero = random_number(1, 100)

// Set the attempt count to 6
attempt_count = 6

// Repeat until the attempt count reaches 0 or the player guesses the correct number
while attempt_count > 0:
    // Prompt the player to enter their guess
    guess = input("Guess the number!\n")

    // If the player's guess is a valid number between 1 and 100
    if is_valid_number(guess):
        guess = convert_to_integer(guess)

        // If the player's guess is equal to the random number
        if guess == numero:
            print("You got it whooooo!!!")
            break
        // If the player's guess is less than the random number
        else if guess < numero:
            print("Too low. Try a higher number.")
        // If the player's guess is greater than the random number
        else:
            print("Too high. Try a lower number.")

        // Decrease the attempt count by 1
        attempt_count = attempt_count - 1

    // If the player's guess is not a valid number between 1 and 100
    else:
        print("Pick a number between 1 and 100 please.")

// If the player runs out of attempts
if attempt_count == 0:
    print("Sorry, you're out of attempts. The correct number was", numero)
