# NumberGuess

This folder simply contains the numbrguessr.py program, and it's iterations based on time.

---

- numbrguessr.py is my final project, a number guessing game.
  - Dependencies:
    - colorama (`pip install colorama`)
  - numbrguessr.py will always be a duplicate of the latest iteration, as it is the main program.
