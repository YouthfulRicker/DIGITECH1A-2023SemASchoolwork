# DIGITECH1A-2023SemASchoolwork

This is some work for my 2023 Digitech Class at [Wainuiomata High School](https://wainuiomatahigh.school.nz/).

Main Project Directory
---
My main project is [numbrguessr.py](NumberGuess/numbrguessr.py), a number guessing game.
The base instruction for this program is to run it, and follow it's instructions to attempt to guess a number, and have fun doing so.

In the [NumberGuess](NumberGuess/) folder, there are three things, two folders, and two files, one being the game, the other being what is essentially a basic information leaflet in a [markdown file](NumberGuess/README.md) such as this.

The two subfolders are named [Iterations](NumberGuess/Iterations) and [Pre-Planning](NumberGuess/Pre-Planning). Iterations contains each main iteration of the numbrguessr program and a [markdown file](NumberGuess/Iterations/README.md) containing a [changelog](NumberGuess/Iterations/README.md#Iterations), a [description of the features and functions](NumberGuess/Iterations/README.md#Stages/Features), and a [testlog](NumberGuess/Iterations/README.md#Testing) of things I tested on each iteration.

Everything mentioned is hyperlinked here, and can also easily be found if otherwise required.

main.py is a directory navigator that will play the file you want to play depending on your input variable.

init.sh is a general command sheet in which you input your git details (username and email). The script assumes your username is the same as the first part of your email. 

Example:
> Email: example@example2.com
>
> Username: example
>
> Script input: ./init.sh example @example2.com
